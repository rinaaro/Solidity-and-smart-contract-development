From the example on slide 10 and 11 of Lecture 3, what would be the output for the second example (HelloWorld(uint[], bool))?

You can calculate the function selector with the provided algorithm on slide 11. For the memory location, you can make it up but remember to observe left and right zero padding for all inputs. (1,5 points)

What would the encodePacked function call give you? (0,5 points)
