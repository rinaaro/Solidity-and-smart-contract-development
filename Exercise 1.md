# Exercise 1

## Part A
4. I reviewed Grace, César, Jean-Baptiste, Kathleen, Jinane, Tung, Xuanzheng, Jahad, and Brian

5. I have 341188549858524300 Wei, which is accurate. The amount reported on my metamask is 0.3412 SepoliaETH, which, as evident in the index.js code, was transformed into Wei (10^18 magnitude) for an exact unrounded amount.

## Part B
The SPDX is an open standard for formatting for security, license compliance, and other software supply chain artifacts. These include the Specification, the License List, tools, and libraries. It is commonly used by firms, organisations, and communities for efficient exchange of data (both machine- and human-readable), simplifying license management, and fostering trust in open source ecosystems.

(check these)
1. "You are starting a new DeFi project which uses a novel way of rewarding investors who lock their tokens in your staking contract." GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0)
The AGPL ensures that all modifications to the DeFi project remain open source, even if the software is accessed over a network. This aligns with the ethos of DeFi, promoting transparency and trust while preventing proprietary forks of your innovative staking mechanism.

2. "Google Cloud Web3 is developing an enterprise grade software which allows other companies to build their own custom blockchain. Google would like to open source certain libraries for the community to maintain while keeping the core technology proprietary." Apache License 2.0
The Apache License 2.0 allows Google to open source specific libraries while retaining the proprietary nature of its core technology. This license enables permissive use, including modification and redistribution, making it attractive for enterprise-grade community adoption while ensuring credit to Google as the original developer.

## Part C

Write a short response, around 300 words, which 1) explains what a VM is (1 point) and 2) Compares the communities developing on the EVM vs SVM stack. (3 points)

Check out the Developer Report by Electric Capital and list a few metrics presented in class or any that you find interesting. Compare and contrast these metrics and draw a conclusion on the health of these communities.

What is a VM?
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system or application. In blockchain contexts, VMs (e.g., Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM) execute smart contracts and manage blockchain operations in an isolated environment to ensure security and consistency across nodes.

Comparing Communities: EVM vs. SVM
The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) powers Ethereum and compatible blockchains (e.g., Polygon, Binance Smart Chain). It has a vast developer community driven by Ethereum’s first-mover advantage, a robust tooling ecosystem, and extensive resources like Solidity and Truffle. The EVM community benefits from significant investment and diverse applications, fostering innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and dApps.

The SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) focuses on Solana's unique high-throughput blockchain, with its Rust-based programming environment. While the SVM community is smaller, it’s highly specialized, prioritizing performance and scalability for low-latency applications. However, its Rust dependency creates a steeper learning curve compared to Solidity.

Metrics and Analysis: According to the Developer Report by Electric Capital, Ethereum leads in developer activity, with over 5,000 monthly active developers, compared to Solana's smaller but fast-growing base. The EVM ecosystem sees broader adoption due to cross-chain compatibility and its mature tooling ecosystem. In contrast, SVM developers emphasize innovative use cases tailored to Solana’s performance edge, such as real-time data and high-speed trading.

Conclusion: The EVM ecosystem is larger and more diversified, reflecting its position as a general-purpose blockchain. However, the SVM community is specialized, prioritizing high-performance dApps. Both ecosystems exhibit strong health, with complementary strengths fostering innovation across the blockchain space.
