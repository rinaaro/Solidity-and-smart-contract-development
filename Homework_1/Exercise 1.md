# Exercise 1

## Part A
4. I reviewed Grace, César, Jean-Baptiste, Kathleen, Jinane, Tung, Xuanzheng, Jahad, and Brian

5. I have 341188549858524300 Wei, which is accurate. The amount reported on my metamask is 0.3412 SepoliaETH, which, as evident in the index.js code, was transformed into Wei (10^18 magnitude) for an exact unrounded amount.

## Part B
The SPDX is an open standard for formatting for security, license compliance, and other software supply chain artifacts. These include the Specification, the License List, tools, and libraries. It is commonly used by firms, organisations, and communities for efficient exchange of data (both machine- and human-readable), simplifying license management, and fostering trust in open source ecosystems.

1. "You are starting a new DeFi project which uses a novel way of rewarding investors who lock their tokens in your staking contract."

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0) ensures that any modifications to the DeFi project remain open source, even in the case of network server software access. This aligns with the principles of DeFi, promoting transparency and trust while preventing proprietary forks over innovative staking mechanisms.

2. "Google Cloud Web3 is developing an enterprise grade software which allows other companies to build their own custom blockchain. Google would like to open source certain libraries for the community to maintain while keeping the core technology proprietary."

The Apache License 2.0 would allow Google to open-source specific libraries while retaining the proprietary nature of its core technology. This license enables permissive use, including modification and redistribution, while ensuring credit to Google as the original developer.

## Part C

A Virtual Machine (VM) is essentially a non-physical computer that has a CPU, memory, and storage that exists purely in code. It runs alongside the physical computer, partitioned from the main system and thus preventing interference with the primary system. It is a cost effective, fast, and scalable way to build and develop dApps, operating systems, and environments. In terms of blockchain, VMs can execute smart contracts and manage blockchain operations in an external environment for simpler development tests as well to ensure security and consistency across nodes.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powers Ethereum and other compatible blockchains. With a vast developer community (mostly driven by Ethereum’s first-mover advantage, extensive tooling and resources), the EVM community benefits from significant investment and diverse applications, fostering innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and dApps.

The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) focuses on Solana's high-throughput blockchain, with the Rust-based programming environment. While the SVM community is smaller, it’s highly specialised, prioritizing scalability for low-latency applications. However, its Rust dependency creates an even steeper learning curve when compared to Ethereum's more familiar and broader choice of languages like Solidity and Vyper.

Some of the metrics included in the Developer Report include 'New repositories by month', 'New developers by month', as well a a distinction between new, emerging, and established developers. The number of new repositories can be seen as a metric for potentially small projects, and along with a high number of new developers by month implies a dominance of newcomers. By these metrics, the EVM Stack is consistently shown as the 'healthiest', with the highest number of active developers, along with broader adoption of EVM due to cross-chain compatibility.

Overall, the EVM stack is currently and consistently the largest and most diversified,reflecting its good 'health' as a multi-purpose blockchain. In contrast, the Solana SVM stack shows a smaller, more specialised community, prioritising high performance.
